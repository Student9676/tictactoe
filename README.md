This program is a solution to problem set 0 of CS50â€™s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python. 
The only part of this program created by me is the utility file; the driver and GUI has been provided by 
the course.

This program's runner.py and OpenSans-Regular.ttf files have been provided by AI50 (i.e. HarvardX) as
a part of project materials. Additionally, the plan for the program along with method names, structure, 
and a basic empty skeleton of the main project file was provided by HarvardX.
